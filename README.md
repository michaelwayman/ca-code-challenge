# Brand Reviews WordPress (Interview Challenge Source)

Self-contained, reproducible WordPress site used as the source for a WP → Django migration challenge.

The site is a small consumer-reviews directory: **brands** with profile pages plus user-submitted **reviews** linked to each brand. Two custom post types, one taxonomy, ACF fields, Yoast SEO metadata.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make up
```

After ~20 seconds:

- Public site: <http://localhost:8080>
- WP admin:    <http://localhost:8080/wp-admin> (`admin` / `admin`)
- phpMyAdmin:  <http://localhost:8081>
- REST root:   <http://localhost:8080/wp-json/wp/v2/>
- Main app:    <http://localhost:8000> (health: `/health/`)
- Auth service: <http://localhost:8001> (health: `/health/`)

Docker is the only host prerequisite. Host ports are set in `.env` (`WP_PORT`, `PMA_PORT`, `APP_PORT`, `AUTH_PORT`); change them if one clashes. Node tooling (bundle, SCSS) runs in the `node` service under the `tools` profile, mounted at `frontend/`: `make node ARGS="npm --version"`. Check status with `docker compose ps`; every service should be running or healthy.

### Compiling the SCSS

The stylesheet source lives in `frontend/scss/`. `main.scss` is the entry file and pulls in partials in `tokens/`, `base/`, `layout/` and `components/`; each commented section of `reference/theme.css` maps to one partial. Compile with Dart Sass in the node container:

```
make node ARGS="npm install"      # first time only
make node ARGS="npm run build:css"
```

This writes `app/static/css/theme.css`, which `base.html` links. Do not edit that file by hand and do not edit `reference/theme.css`. To add a component, create `frontend/scss/components/_name.scss` and add an `@use` line to `main.scss`; use the custom properties from `tokens/_tokens.scss` rather than literal colours.

The DB is auto-imported from `db/dump.sql` on first boot. No manual setup required for candidates.

## What's committed

```
docker-compose.yml          # the stack
.env.example                # config defaults
Makefile                    # make targets
db/dump.sql                 # seeded database snapshot
scripts/seed.sh             # bootstrap script (install + plugins + seed)
wp-content/plugins/         # WP default plugins + ACF + Yoast (committed for offline reproducibility)
wp-content/mu-plugins/
  cpt.php                   # registers `brand` and `review` CPTs and `industry` taxonomy
  acf-fields.php            # registers ACF field groups in code
wp-content/themes/
  consumer-reviews/         # custom theme used by the site
```

WP core files and the default themes (e.g. twentytwentyfour) live inside the `wp_files` named volume and are recreated from the image on first boot. Only the custom `consumer-reviews` theme is committed to the repo.

## Make targets

```
make up         # start db + wordpress + phpmyadmin
make down       # stop containers (keeps volumes)
make reset      # stop AND wipe volumes (next 'up' re-imports dump.sql)
make logs       # tail wordpress + db
make wp ARGS="plugin list"   # run wp-cli inside the stack
make bootstrap  # full re-seed: WP core install + plugin install + content seed
make dump       # export the current DB to db/dump.sql
make status     # show running services
```

## Rebuilding the dump from scratch

If you change the schema or seed data:

```bash
make reset
make up
make bootstrap
make dump
git add db/dump.sql wp-content/plugins
git commit -m "Refresh seed data"
```

`make bootstrap` is idempotent enough to re-run, but the cleanest path is reset → up → bootstrap → dump.

## Content model

**`brand` CPT** at `/brand/<slug>/`
- Standard fields: title, content (body), featured image (optional)
- ACF fields: `website_url`, `founded_year`, `headquarters`, `average_rating`
- Taxonomy: `industry`
- Yoast: `_yoast_wpseo_title`, `_yoast_wpseo_metadesc` in postmeta

**`review` CPT** at `/review/<slug>/`
- Standard fields: title, content (review body), post_author (mapped to a real WP user)
- ACF fields: `rating` (1-5), `reviewer_name`, `reviewer_location`, `brand` (post object → brand id)

Seeded volume: 5 brands (one per industry), 60 reviews (12 per brand) authored by 8 reviewer users, 3 static pages (Home/About/Contact), 1 admin user.

## Theme

The active theme is a custom one at `wp-content/themes/consumer-reviews/` (committed to the repo). It renders:

- Homepage with featured brands and recent reviews
- Brand archive (`/brand/`) — card grid
- Single brand page (`/brand/<slug>/`) — hero with industry badge, star rating, website / founded / HQ metadata, body content, and full list of customer reviews
- Review archive (`/review/`) — paginated list
- Single review (`/review/<slug>/`) — back-link to brand, star rating, reviewer name/location, body
- Page template for About / Contact / Home pages

The theme is intentionally small (~10 PHP files + one stylesheet) and is meant to show candidates what the data renders as. They are not expected to clone the theme — just to migrate the underlying data.

## Endpoints worth knowing

- `/wp-json/wp/v2/brands` — list brands (note: `rest_base` is `brands` even though post type is `brand`)
- `/wp-json/wp/v2/brands/<id>` — single brand with ACF fields under `acf`
- `/wp-json/wp/v2/reviews` — list reviews
- `/wp-json/wp/v2/industry` — taxonomy terms
- `/wp-json/wp/v2/users` — reviewer users
- `/wp-json/wp/v2/pages` — static pages

ACF fields are exposed natively via `show_in_rest: true` set in `wp-content/mu-plugins/acf-fields.php`.

## Brand listing API

`GET /api/brands/` is public. Parameters: `industry` (repeatable slug), `ordering`, `page`, `page_size`. Its snippet rule is below; the full contract is documented under R21.

### Top review snippet

The "top" review of a brand is the one with the **highest rating**; ties are broken by the **newest** `published_at` (then highest id). `top_review_snippet` is that review's body with HTML tags removed and whitespace collapsed, cut to the **first 140 characters**. A brand with no reviews returns `null` for `top_review_snippet` and `average_rating`, and `0` for `review_count`.

## Notes for the maintainer

- The `wp-content/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/` and `wp-content/plugins/wordpress-seo/` plugin code is GPL and committed to the repo so candidates don't need internet on first boot.
- `wp-content/plugins/akismet/` and `hello.php` are WP defaults — left in place but inactive.
- The site URL is hardcoded as `http://localhost:8080` in the dump (in `wp_options.siteurl` and `home`). Changing the port requires a search/replace in `db/dump.sql` before commit, or just override via `WP_HOME` / `WP_SITEURL` constants.
- `_yoast_wpseo_*` postmeta is seeded for brand posts only.
